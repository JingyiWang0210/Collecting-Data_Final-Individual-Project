Across the Furious Sea, a crime thriller by award-winning director Cao Baoping, has topped the single-day box office charts for three consecutive days since opening on Nov 25.
Released in multiple formats, including IMAX, it is an adaptation of the novella of the same name by Lao Huang, which was inspired by the real-life case of a Chinese student murdered by her classmate while she was studying in the United States.
The film stars Huang Bo as a fisherman who discovers that his daughter has been brutally murdered while studying in Japan, and that the prime suspect is her boyfriend. The young man skillfully evades capture to return to China under the protection of his mother, played by veteran actress Zhou Xun. Overwhelmed by grief and anger, the fisherman embarks on a journey of revenge.
Although China does not have a film rating system, due to the violent scenes it contains, the promotional materials for the movie suggest that it is not appropriate for those under 18.
