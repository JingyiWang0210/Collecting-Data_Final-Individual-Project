Amid the surging popularity of fantasy martial arts tales, both domestically and overseas, shooting was recently announced for new heavyweight drama at an event hosted by Hunan Television, Mango TV, and Migu Video on Saturday.
Shui Long Yin (Water Dragon's Chant) is an adaptation of Teng Ping's serialized martial arts novel Qian Jie Mei (Enduring a Thousand Tribulations). The fantastic tale centers around a highly skilled but introverted and even indifferent swordsman, as he embarks on martial arts adventures. The protagonist is played by Luo Yunxi, who is known for his role in fantasy drama Till the End of the Moon.
A poster for the drama was revealed during the event, featuring a swordsman riding a white fox that has transformed into dragon, and which was inspired by a short story in Taiping Guangji (Extensive Records of the Taiping Era), a collection of mythological novels compiled in the 10th century.
