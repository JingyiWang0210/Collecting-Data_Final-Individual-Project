Around 1,500 years ago, the renowned agronomist Jia Sixie wrote his masterpiece Qimin Yaoshu (Essential Techniques for the Welfare of the People), the earliest existing comprehensive agricultural text in China.
Within this monumental work that systematically documents agricultural production, there is an account of a dish known as Jinji Yukuai (fish slices coated with golden-colored "seasoning powders"). The delectable treat garnered acclaim from poets throughout history, including Li Bai during the Tang Dynasty (618-907) and Su Shi during the Song Dynasty (960-1279).
In A Taste of History, a variety show produced by the China Media Group, the famous delicacy was re-created, propelling it to online popularity.
For its second season, the show, which has been airing on China Central Television's website and CCTV-3 since early August, traveled to nine provinces, such as Hubei, Shandong and Sichuan, as well as Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang Uygur autonomous regions.

TV veteran Ren Luyu, anchor Ma Fanshu, artist Ouyang Yingji, and journalist Wang Bingbing have served as hosts, and were accompanied by different celebrity guests for each episode, as they embarked on mouthwatering culinary trips that also shed light on the cultural influence of delicacies, as well as how societal progress and technological improvement has influenced Chinese people's dining table.
Former host Ni Ping and actress Liu Tao were invited in the first episode as guests to join the team to visit Wujiang district in Suzhou, a city in Jiangsu province known for its plentiful natural resources, particularly its fish.
