Chen Jinhua, the Chinese distributor of the movie, revealed the film took a total of seven years on preparation and producing, with the animation team consisting of artists working for the 2014 Japanese 3D computer-animated movie Stand by Me Doraemon.
The movie was released in Japan in August, grossing over 2.5 billion Japanese yen ($16.7 million) to become the highest-grossing film of the Crayon Shinchan cinematic franchise, according to Chen.
So far, the movie has raked in 5 million yuan ($700,000) in presale, following director Cao Baoping's crime thriller Across the Furious Sea to sit in the second slot on the country's presale box office charts on Saturday, according to the movie information tracer Beacon.
