iQIYI, the popular video-streaming platform, has recently introduced an innovative AI search featuring the pioneering function of "plot search", offering a novel experience for video viewers. To access this cutting-edge function, users must update their iQIYI app to version V14.9.0 or higher.
Unlike the traditional search methods that yield only movie titles as initial results, iQIYI's upgraded AI search empowers viewers to instantly access their desired content during the search process. This marks a groundbreaking application of generative AI technology across three search scenarios: character search, plot search and actor/actress search, thus enriching viewers' content discovery with a wealth of recommendations.
The updated search results page not only simplifies the process of locating preferred video content for viewers but also enables them to directly access popular characters, pivotal plot scenes and cast members by using straightforward keywords.
This new feature has been applied to iQIYI's exclusive series Romance on the Farm. To illustrate, in the case of this TV drama, when viewers enter the character name "Lianmaner" in the search bar, the results will display the drama itself, the corresponding actress Tian Xiwei and offer recommendations for associated highlight plot moments.
Plot search is another standout feature of the new AI search. When users input specific plot snippets they wish to see, and click on the associated plot topics, they are promptly directed to the corresponding part of that content. Moreover, on the same page, users can find comprehensive plot descriptions and recommendations for notable plot highlights.
In addition to Romance on the Farm, several other renowned content IPs, including Destined and The Big Band 3, have harnessed generative AI support, both within and beyond the iQIYI platform.
Statistical data shows that, in the case of plot search, viewers who utilize AI to access full episodes have seen a 40% increase in their average viewing duration.
