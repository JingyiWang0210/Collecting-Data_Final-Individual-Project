Xin Yukun, who is known for exploring the intricacies of human nature, explores the social impact of the internet for his latest film, Trending Topic, which was one of the most anticipated releases in the domestic movie sector at the 2023 China Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Film Festival.
The film revolves around Chen Miao, an aspiring editor at a social media platform, who writes a popular article discussing a video in which a girl is seen to push her classmate down a set of stairs. The article triggers a widespread online condemnation campaign, which drives the apparent bully, a teenage girl, to attempt suicide by jumping off a building.
When she receives a package from the girl that reveals the horrifying truth that the "bully" may actually be a victim of sexual assault, Chen becomes determined to seek justice for the girl and redeem herself, and confronts the darkest chapter in her career.
The film stars Zhou Dongyu, Song Yang and Yuan Hong.
Xin, who shot to fame with his directorial debut Deep in the Heart, said he feels it is his responsibility to show power of the digital world.
The movie is scheduled to open in theaters on Dec 1.
