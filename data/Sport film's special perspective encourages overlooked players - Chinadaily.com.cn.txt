Lose to Win, a comedy hit during the National Day holiday, has proved a successful remake of Spain's highest-grossing movie of 2018, its creators and industry insiders said at a symposium in Beijing on Nov 9.
Li Yaping, chief producer of the Chinese remake, said that the most interesting element of the original Spanish film, Champions, was its depiction of the unexpected tension between a coach, who yearns to win, and a group of basketball players with disabilities, who struggle in learning the competition rules.
Starring Wei Xiang as the coach, Lose to Win starts with Wei's character being forced to work at a special education school for students with learning disabilities as punishment for a mistake in his career. Despite initial difficulties, the coach finally works out his own way to enable the team to experience the joy of basketball competitions.
