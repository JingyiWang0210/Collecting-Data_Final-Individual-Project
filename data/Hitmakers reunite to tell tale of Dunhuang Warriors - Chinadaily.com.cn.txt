After being impressed by The Silk Road, a 1988 Japanese movie based on the novel Tun-Huang written by Yasushi Inoue, producer Zhang Miao has harbored a strong desire, believing that the captivating history and rich civilization of Dunhuang must be retold through a Chinese lens.
His wish has been realized through Dunhuang Warriors, a historic epic scheduled to open across China on Dec 22. The news was announced during an event on Nov 4, the last day of the 2023 Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Festival, in Xiamen, Fujian province.
The upcoming movie marks the second collaboration between director Cao Dun and novelist Ma Boyong, following their 2019 runaway hit The Longest Day in Chang'an, a 48-episode series which depicts an attempt to thwart a dastardly plan to overthrow a Tang Dynasty (618-907) ruler.

Also set during the Tang Dynasty, Dunhuang Warriors recounts the story of Zhang Yichao, a legendary general who led locals in Dunhuang to fight against invaders and restore the area's allegiance to the Tang Dynasty.
The cast members include actors Zhang Yu, Shaw Dou, Lyu Liang, and actress Zhao Yunzhuo.
