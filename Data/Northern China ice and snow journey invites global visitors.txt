Actors get their kicks in new show

"Nihao! China" - the 2024 Northern China Ice and Snow Tourism Overseas Promotion Season was launched on Dec 21, inviting international tourists to explore the enchanting winter landscapes of China.

The event is co-hosted by the China National Tourist Office and the China Cultural Center in Sydney, as well as the Network of International Culturallink Entities, in collaboration with the cultural and tourism departments (bureaus) from Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Xinjiang.

Accessible through the official website and social platforms of the China National Tourist Office and the China Cultural Center in Sydney, this virtual experience kicked off with a theme photo exhibit Continuing to Write the Grand Chapter of Ice and Snow. Subsequently, it will display the distinctive ice and snow tourism offerings from the nine regions in China.

The entire promotion season lasts until the end of January.

The event aims to fully leverage China's "cool" ice and snow resources to stimulate the "hot" economy of culture and tourism, as well as to promote cultural exchange and highlight China's distinctive ice and snow tourism internationally.

Through a curated collection of exhibitions and videos, the ice and snow cultural resources of each region, as well as China's national tourism image, are promoted. This will unfold the profound beauty of China's ice and snow culture and tourism, deepening appreciation among the Australian public and drawing more Australians to fly to China to experience the picturesque wintry wonderland in person.
