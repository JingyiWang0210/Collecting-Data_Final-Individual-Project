Chou to go global with new music deal

On Dec 6, pop icon Jay Chou launched a partnership with the Universal Music Greater China, a division of Universal Music Group.

The agreement includes the global marketing and distribution rights for the singer's extensive catalog and covers future projects, and also supports rising talent signed to his record label JVR Music.

The singer-songwriter has been a Mandarin music phenomenon since his groundbreaking debut in 2000, JAY.

With 15 studio albums under his belt, Chou's latest album, Greatest Works of Art, which was released last year, made him the first Mandarin singer to break into the top 10 of the IFPI Global Artist Chart, and also the first to top the Global Album Sales Chart.

He has also achieved significant success in the realms of film and art. Chou's directorial debut, Secret, has won multiple awards, and he subsequently ventured into Hollywood with roles in The Green Hornet and Now You See Me 2. In recent years, he has collaborated with auction houses Sotheby's and Christie's as a curator, continuing to exert his influence across various fields.

In 2007, along with Vincent Fang, and JR Yang, Chou founded his own music label, JVR Music.

"This strategic partnership marks a new chapter for Jay Chou and JVR toward our vision of elevating Mandarin pop music globally. Leveraging UMG's extensive global network enables us to amplify Chou's artistic impact and the diversity of our artists on a global scale," said JR Yang, chief executive officer of JVR Music.

"It is with immense pride and excitement that we welcome Jay Chou, an icon of our times, into the Universal Music family. This partnership is more than a milestone for us. It's a celebration of Jay Chou's extraordinary artistry and global appeal," said Timothy Xu, chairman and chief executive officer of Universal Music Greater China.
